<p>These are some of the common building blocks I have pullled from my research into this layer of the API space.</p>

<h2>Discovery</h2>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<ul>
<li><strong>List SDK</strong> - Are SDKs listed in an easy to find location, where developers can browse them easily? A simple list goes a long way in making them found.</li>
<li><strong>Search SDK</strong> - Is there the ability to search for SDKs, using a single index dedicated to them, or possibly using Github's already available search mechanisms.</li>
<li><strong>Browse SDK</strong> - Is there a browseable directory of SDKs, that developers can use to find the SDK that they need? Potentially giving more information than just a listing.</li>
<li><strong>Rating</strong> - Are SDKs rated, allowing for various quality considerations around their value and usage in other API integrations, allowing developers to find the best SDKs possible.</li>
